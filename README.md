## What changed

Make it work, so skills can be overleveled and active. Make it compatible with https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/10482

## Caution

Class method there returns new raised max level (3->5, 2->4, I didn't change that), I have no idea what consequences of this will be. It can make skills stronger/weaker/no changes. Please pay attention on it.
